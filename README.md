# Bitpost
This is a project based on blockchain to Create a web page where user can post 
texts and get paid by other users of the site for a post in the form of a tip which is 
given in form of a cryptocurrency known as ETHER.
The transactions are carried out by smart contracts which automate all transfers of 
cryptocurrency and are also responsible for posting on the blockchain for questions 
on ganache. This project uses Web 3.0 which helps in converting our ether or any 
other cryptocurrency we use to “Wei” and vice-a-versa.

## Technology Used
- Blockchain technology using Ganache - a local blockchain
- Solidity programming language to create smart contracts
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for front-end
- MetaMask - For managing cryptocurrency wallet interacting with Ethereum Blockchain Network
= Truffle and Ganache - For deploying and simulating a local blockchain over the host machine
- Npm - Installing node packages and giving commands for deploying modules.

## Features
This is a project deployed on the blockchain network which allows different users to post on a website it also allows monetary transactions in ether and allows users to tip in ether on different posts of different users.
Due to the nature of the blockchain technology, it is immutable which causes it to be secure on the condition that the number of users have crossed the critical threshold and also provides anonymity to the user.
It cuts out the middleman and directly transfers the funds to the wallets of the users.

## Conclusion
We have achieved the following results from our decentralized blockchain application:-
- Increased transaction speeds - high speed international transactions within minutes, no hassle with banks.
- Minimal Gas Fees - Minimal Transaction fees compared to banks 
- Decentralization - No involvement of 3rd parties.
- High Transparency and security due to a central database.

## Future Scope

The main objective of our project is to gain decentralization by creating an app where people can freely share their thoughts. A lot of Blockchain and Dapp developers have been working on this technology and even have created really beautiful web applications like “mediachain” which uses smart contracts to get artists paid what they deserve or “filament” which focuses on the development of hardware products for use in blockchain-based connected device networks.
Many developers have been comparing and making upgrades in their work but this technology is limitless and boundless due to its dimensionless parameters. Our effort is also to understand the use of blockchain as well as understanding safety and security concerns regarding privacy and data protection or data forging.
From our study of the project, we are able to deduce that the project can serve as a really good bare - minimum or basic template part for a big project. Changing its User Interface to make it more concise and distinguishable to different parts of society is a really good approach.
